      <description>###Project 2: Modeling, Testing and Predicting on Data for Food Insecurity in Texas Counties
#Introduction
The dataset that was chosen for this project is centered around health across counties in Texas. The dataset contains 12 different variables for different health measures across counties in Texas. A few of these variables include average life expectancy, the rate of diabetes prevalence, rates of both food insecurity across the county and the rate of limited food access in the counties, average household incomes, free/reduced lunch rates among school-aged children, urbanization status indicators of whether the counties are rural or urban, and the border status of the counties, which indicates whether or not they are on the border.</description>

      <description>Project 1 Exploratory Data Analysis: Food Insecurity and Demographics in Texas Counties #Introduction The two datasets that were chosen for this project center around health across counties in Texas. The “health” dataset contains 15 different variables for different health measures across counties in Texas. These variables include the names of Texas counties, average life expectancy, the rate at which members of the population are in frequent mental distress, the rate of diabetes prevalence, rates of both food insecurity across the county and the rate of limited food access in the counties, rates of the amount of uninsured adults and children, average household incomes across three races: white, black and hispanic, free/reduced lunch rates among school-aged children, urbanization status indicators of whether the counties are rural or urban, and the border status of the counties, which indicates whether or not they are on the border.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>
